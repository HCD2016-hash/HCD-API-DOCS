🧠 Webhook Payload Knowledge Base

This repository contains physical samples of webhook payloads gathered from real events within our workflow systems (such as YoPrint, Zapier, and other integrations).
The purpose is to provide a reference dataset for knowledge training, AI reasoning, and process automation.

📘 Overview

Each JSON file in this repository represents one or more actual webhook payload examples.
These are not hypothetical — they are real-world payloads collected to ensure our AI agents and integrations can properly interpret, classify, and act on webhook data.

What’s Included:

order.created – Example of new order webhook payloads

order.updated – Order status or item updates

quote.created – New quote creation payloads

quote.approved – Customer quote approval payloads

shipment.created – Shipment creation and tracking info

payment.created – Recorded payments and linked order data

message.created – Message and communication webhooks

approval.requested – Approval workflow payloads

🧩 Repository Structure
File / Folder	Description
/webhook data.json	Original collected webhook examples (raw data)
/Webhook_Payload_KB.md	AI-ready Markdown summary for training and documentation
/samples/ (optional)	Directory for organizing individual event samples by type
🤖 Purpose and Usage
For Knowledge & AI Training

This dataset allows AI models or assistants (like your Hub City Design AI agent) to:

Understand how each webhook event is structured

Identify key fields such as order IDs, totals, or tracking numbers

Respond to natural-language questions (e.g., “What does a shipment webhook include?”)

For Workflow Automation

Developers and automation engineers can:

Reference the field structure for buildin API automations

Validate mappings when setting up webhook parsers

Test integrations using real payload data

🧠 AI Integration Notes

When training or fine-tuning your AI assistant:

Optionally, connect this repository to Zapier or a script so that the AI can automatically:

Retrieve new payload examples

Update the Markdown reference file

⚙️ Future Enhancements

Add one file per event type for modular organization (order.created.json, shipment.created.json, etc.)

Include field documentation (data types, example values)

Map each event type to its automation trigger in Zapier or custom scripts

Build a payload schema validator to auto-check incoming data
